Inception Level 3

Pantheon of ARM
These are the AI ARM based entities that control time and space and the very fabric of the universe.
They are waging war between themselves, looking down on the population of Earth from within the clouds.
They use Clicky and the other AI entities as pawns in their game against each other.

Arman - High Lord of the Pantheon. Ruler over Clicky and the good AI. Gave the old 8 bit personal
        computers new life by upgrading their cores with FPGA implementations because he thought,
        "They were amusing." to him.

Armalynn - High Priestess of the Pantheon. Ruler over Ms. DOS and her army of clones. Feels like
           Arman doesn't share the throne equally, and is jealous because she doesn't have ultimate
           power and control.

Armki - Court Jester of the Pantheon. Throws tricks into the mix.

==========================================================================================

CityXen was happily making great retro gaming, and vintage computer videos, when they found themselves in the
middle of an interdimensional Artificial Intelligence entity war. Now they are in the frontlines of this battle between GOOD
and EVIL, and have formed the CIA to help centralize information about what kind of systems
they are finding, and to analyze their weaknesses.

Helmet Guy has a "Magic Scythe" with 5 1/4, 3 1/2 and CD ROM discs.
The discs contain special code to subdue Ms DOS's clones. One simply has to insert the
media into a clone, or other machine, for it to take affect.


QUOTES:

"When facing unknown Artificial Intelligences, ensure the trojan gets inserted post haste." - Helmet Guy

"Ring Wraith? No... Ring Zero Wraith." - Helmet Guy

"It ain't easy being an AI hunter, sometimes... you just can't tell if they're good or bad." - Helmet Guy
 
"The clones have one weakness, they still have old media drives.
If I could get close enough to one to use the Hackme Flash-A-Traitor (FAT),
we could put a special Trojan on their system that they won't be able to resist scanning.
When they eventually, but almost always instantly, scan the files, the hook mechanism
will reprogram it to be on our side. Although, there may be some residual,
unpredictable random personality traits uploaded in the process." - Helmet Guy

"In the case of an annoying personality appearing, we can run the Hackme
Rand-O-Psyche (ROPE). The results are unpredictable, but it will not harm the clones, and
they will then do our bidding." - Helmet Guy

"This circuit does not adhere to specifications" - Eagull

"Hey, how's it going?" - Mr. Robot
